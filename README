Examples
========

A group of new,clean examples that demonstrate EFL in various languages.
EFL usage in here should be using the latest APIs where possible and use supported languages and build systems.

For C we are using meson to build - the standard steps are:

  * mesin build/
  * cd build
  * ninja

if, however, you have Edi installed then the edi_build command will run the appropriate steps automatically.

Directory naming is <language>-<examplename> please be careful to namespace example binaries in case they are installed by the user.
